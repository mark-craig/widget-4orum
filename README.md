In the html for a given page for production purposes, put the following two lines where you want your comment section to exist.
First, add a *div* with id root.
```
<div id="root"></div>
```

Then add this script to the bottom of your html file:

```
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/mark-craig/f06b4fbd5246888bf0b493ae38378f02/raw/572714ef1281d1b0bed2b1b5b2188ff25e807f8a/main.190b807f.js"></script>
```

Finally, include this stylesheet:

```
<link href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/mark-craig/ac87f8f778caf2bc4257e445714ff266/raw/636482f0ed0e5e2286db6b8081159f7c5c4a0296/main.f8f7393c.css" rel="stylesheet">
