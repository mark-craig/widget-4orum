# widget-4orum
A React and JQuery script that embeds an div of the [comments-4orum](https://github.com/gigibyte927/comments-4orum) Django app into a given page.

# Usage: How to Embed a 4orum Comment on your Website
In the html for a given page for production purposes, put the following two lines where you want your comment section to exist.
First, add a *div* with id root.
```
<div id="root"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/mark-craig/frame-4orum/ea5d1df9/bundle.js"></script>
```

Replace "https://cdn.rawgit.com/mark-craig/frame-4orum/ea5d1df9/bundle.js" with "https://rawgit.com/mark-craig/frame-4orum/master/bundle.js" for development purposes.

RawGit is tracking the bundle.js file in this repo. From the RawGit website:

Use this URL for development
https://rawgit.com/mark-craig/frame-4orum/master/bundle.js
* New changes you push to GitHub will be reflected within minutes.
* Excessive traffic will be throttled and blacklisted.
* If excessive traffic continues, RawGit will display a prominent error message on your website to try to get your attention.

Use this URL in production
https://cdn.rawgit.com/mark-craig/frame-4orum/ea5d1df9/bundle.js
* No traffic limits or throttling. Files are served via StackPath's super fast global CDN.
* Use a specific tag or commit hash in the URL (not a branch). Files are cached permanently based on the URL. Query strings are ignored.
* The catch: this is a free service, so there are no uptime or support guarantees.
